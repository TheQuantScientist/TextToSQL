    "question": "What is the relationship between interest rate, unemployment rate and corporate profits? Propose strategy for policymakers to promote corporate activities",
    "query": "Here is a SQL query to analyze the relationship between interest rate, unemployment rate, and corporate profits: ``` SELECT    interest_rate,    unemployment_rate,    corporate_profits FROM    finance_economics_dataset ORDER BY    interest_rate,    unemployment_rate LIMIT 50; ``` This query selects the interest rate, unemployment rate, and corporate profits columns from the `finance_economics_dataset` table, orders the results by interest rate and unemployment rate, and limits the output to 50 rows.  Based on the results, policymakers can propose the following strategies to promote corporate activities:  1. **Monetary policy adjustments**: If the query reveals a negative correlation between interest rates and corporate profits, policymakers can consider lowering interest rates to stimulate borrowing and investment, which can boost corporate activities. 2. **Fiscal policy interventions**: If the query shows a positive correlation between unemployment rates and corporate profits, policymakers can implement fiscal policies aimed at reducing unemployment, such as job creation programs or infrastructure investments, to stimulate corporate growth. 3. **Structural reforms**: If the query indicates a strong correlation between interest rates and unemployment rates, policymakers can consider implementing structural reforms to improve labor market flexibility, reduce unemployment, and create a more favorable business environment for corporate activities.  Note: The proposed strategies are based on general economic principles and may require further analysis and consideration of additional factors, such as GDP growth, inflation, and global economic trends, to develop a comprehensive policy framework.",
