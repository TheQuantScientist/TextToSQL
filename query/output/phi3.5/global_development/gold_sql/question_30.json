    "question": "Do countries with high weather vulnerability score have higher green transition scores? Explain for me the implication",
    "query": "Here is the SQL query to answer the question: ``` SELECT    country_name,    climate_vulnerability_index,    green_transition_score FROM    global_development_indicators ORDER BY    climate_vulnerability_index DESC LIMIT 50; ``` This query selects the country name, climate vulnerability index, and green transition score from the `global_development_indicators` table. It orders the results by the climate vulnerability index in descending order (highest to lowest) and limits the output to 50 rows.  The implication of this query is to investigate whether countries with high climate vulnerability scores (i.e., those most susceptible to weather-related disasters) tend to have higher green transition scores, which indicate a country's readiness to transition to a low-carbon economy.  If the results show a positive correlation between climate vulnerability index and green transition score, it could suggest that countries most vulnerable to climate change are also more likely to invest in green technologies and sustainable practices to mitigate its impacts. This could be due to various factors, such as:  1. Increased awareness and concern about climate change among governments and citizens in vulnerable countries. 2. Greater need for climate resilience and adaptation measures, which may drive investment in green technologies. 3. International pressure and support for climate action, which may encourage vulnerable countries to transition to a low-carbon economy.  On the other hand, if the results show no correlation or a negative correlation between climate vulnerability index and green transition score, it could indicate that other factors, such as economic development, political will, or access to resources, play a more significant role in determining a country's green transition score.",
