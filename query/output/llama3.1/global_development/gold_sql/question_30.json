    "question": "Do countries with high weather vulnerability score have higher green transition scores? Explain for me the implication",
    "query": "Here is the SQL query to answer the question: ``` SELECT    country_name,    climate_vulnerability_index,    green_transition_score FROM    global_development_indicators ORDER BY    climate_vulnerability_index DESC LIMIT 50; ``` This query selects the country name, climate vulnerability index, and green transition score from the `global_development_indicators` table. It orders the results by the climate vulnerability index in descending order (highest to lowest) and limits the output to 50 rows.  The implication of this query is to investigate whether countries with high climate vulnerability scores (i.e., those most susceptible to weather-related disasters) tend to have higher green transition scores, which indicate a country's readiness to transition to a low-carbon economy.  If the results show a positive correlation between climate vulnerability index and green transition score, it could suggest that countries most vulnerable to climate change are also more likely to prioritize green transition and sustainable development. This could be due to various factors, such as:  1. Increased awareness and concern about climate change among governments and citizens in vulnerable countries. 2. Greater need for sustainable development and green infrastructure to mitigate the impacts of climate change. 3. International pressure and support for climate-resilient development in vulnerable countries.  On the other hand, if the results show no correlation or a negative correlation, it could indicate that climate vulnerability does not necessarily drive green transition efforts, and other factors, such as economic development, political will, or international cooperation, may play a more significant role in shaping a country's green transition trajectory.",
