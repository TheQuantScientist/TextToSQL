    "question": "Does higher gdp per capita posiviely correlated with high income inequality? Explain possible reasons",
    "query": "Here is a SQL query to explore the relationship between GDP per capita and income inequality: ``` SELECT    gdp_ppp_pc_usd2011,    gini_recalculated,    COUNT(*) AS num_countries FROM    country_income WHERE    year = 2011  -- focus on a specific year for simplicity GROUP BY    gdp_ppp_pc_usd2011,    gini_recalculated ORDER BY    gdp_ppp_pc_usd2011,    gini_recalculated LIMIT 50; ``` This query groups the data by GDP per capita and Gini coefficient, and counts the number of countries in each group. By examining the resulting table, we can look for patterns or correlations between GDP per capita and income inequality.  Possible reasons for a positive correlation between higher GDP per capita and high income inequality:  * Wealth concentration: In countries with high GDP per capita, a small elite may hold a disproportionate amount of wealth, leading to higher income inequality. * Economic growth driven by a few industries: If a country's economic growth is driven by a few high-productivity industries, such as finance or technology, it may lead to a widening income gap between those who work in these industries and those who do not. * Inequality in access to education and job opportunities: In countries with high GDP per capita, access to quality education and job opportunities may be limited to a privileged few, perpetuating income inequality. * Tax policies and social safety nets: Countries with high GDP per capita may have less progressive tax policies or weaker social safety nets, allowing income inequality to persist.  Note that this query is just a starting point, and further analysis would be needed to draw more definitive conclusions about the relationship between GDP per capita and income inequality.",
